# Asymmetric Altis
Arma 3 ALiVE sandbox set slightly before the events of the campaign [*The East Wind*](http://arma3.com/features/campaign), in which the [FIA](http://arma3.com/features/factions) fight to wrestle control of Altis from the hands of the AAF and the government they helped put in place.

Players are members of Special Operations branch of the FIA that may deal with the AAF in whichever manner they see fit. The ALiVE AI Commander (OPCOM) modules will simulate large-scale operations between the remaining asymmetrical FIA forces and the conventional AAF.

Given the dynamic nature of the mission and the open-ended objective to pacify the AAF and unseat the government, players are encouraged to use the ALiVE [Command and Control (C2ISTAR)](http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Command_%26_Control) and [Data (Persistence)](http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/ALiVE_Data) modules to create persistent intelligence (SPOTREPs, PATROLREPs, advanced markers) on the AAF's strength and disposition.
